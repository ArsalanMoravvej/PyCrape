# PythonScraping

<br>

## Description

Here I'm gonna try implementing some crawling projects with python libraries and frameworks (right now Scrapy, BeautifulSoup and Selenium).

## Installation

Installation methods and requirements are gonna be provided in each section.

## Usage

Each of these projects can act either as an utility tool for helping a bigger project or as a standalone scraping bot.
